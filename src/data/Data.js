This progressive approach contributes to advancing scientific knowledge and aligns with the principles of the 3Rs—replacement, reduction, and refinement—in toxicological research. Beyond mere exploration, we're focused on understanding and bridging gaps to improve access to snakebite treatments. It is an effort to advance healthcare and uncover the hidden nature of the enigmatic yet crucial organisms that coexist in our shared environment.",

With the Gharial Ecology Project (GEP) team, we address genetic fitness, population genetics, and the unique mating and parental care systems.",
