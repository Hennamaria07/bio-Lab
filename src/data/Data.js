We have started long-term monitoring of frogs and toads in the seasonal streams of Tillari Conservation Reserve, to understand the mechanisms of tolerance/resistance against Bd in the amphibian community here. ",

    dec:"Snakes are synanthropic species making human snake interaction inevitable. Out of the total number of snakes found in India, only 1/6th are venomous. Venom is an important survival trait, but venomous snakes are understudied, causing large knowledge gaps. We perform functional genomics, venomics and antivenomics to understand the venom and associated venom system. We also address gaps in treatment outcomes, epidemiology of snake-bites and effectiveness of antivenom.",

    dec:"Gharial is a long-lived, long-snouted crocodile and an apex predator, surviving in large rivers of the Indian subcontinent. Unlike other crocodilian species, gharials are highly social, polygynous, and show communal breeding, followed by intense parental care by the male. With the Gharial ecology project (GEP) team, we address genetic fitness, population genetics and the unique mating and parental care system. ",

We have assessed the genetic fitness of the captive population of these three species  in collaboration with The Madras Crocodile Bank Trust and Centre for Herpetology. This would strengthen reintroduction programs in north Indian rivers.",
