    dec: "Chytridiomycosis is a fungal disease caused by the pathogens, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal), which has caused declines in amphibian populations worldwide. Asia is considered as a coldspot of infection, since adult frogs are less susceptible to Bd-induced mortality or morbidity. Using the next-generation sequencing approach, we assessed the cutaneous bacterial community composition and presence of anti-Bd bacteria in six frog species from India using DNA isolated from skin swabs.",

They are omnivorous and re-ported to feed on fruits, leaves, molluscs, beetles and millipedes (Moll et al., 1986). However, the ecology  of  the  species  is  poorly  documented. The only published report on the diet of the spe-cies by  Moll  et  al. (1986),  stated  that  20–70% of their diet was composed of animal material.",

Species turnover (using 1-Sorenson’s index) was estimated between all possible pairs of sites at three spatial scales — within drainage, between drainage and between hill ranges.",

Similarly, sexual dimorphism in size in Rana temporalis has been reported (see Boulenger, 1920), but it poses a problem when individuals have to be sexed using just one or a few morphological criteria.",

There was no synchrony in nesting between reservoir and stream habitats. Aggregation of nests in the stream habitat or scattered nesting in the reservoir may have resulted due to differences in the quality of the habitats.",
