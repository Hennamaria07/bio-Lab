Venom is an important survival trait, but venomous snakes are understudied, causing large knowledge gaps. We perform functional genomics, venomics and antivenomics to understand the venom and associated venom system. We also address gaps in treatment outcomes, epidemiology of snake-bites and effectiveness of antivenom.",

Unlike other crocodilian species, gharials are highly social, polygynous, and show communal breeding, followed by intense parental care by the male. With the Gharial ecology project (GEP) team, we address genetic fitness, population genetics and the unique mating and parental care system. ",
